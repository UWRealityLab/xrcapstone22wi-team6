                            | This week we completed a succcessful dry run of demonstrating our application to our fellow peers and classmates. We are now
                            | in the final stretch of working toward refining our application and getting our trailer video for demo day.
                            | Please see our most up to date demo application

                            | Jane did some user testing of the application, thinking of different combinations actions that the user might take concerning
                            | the menu. She found a few bugs that happened after playing around with the media controls and activities so she was able to
                            | update the pause/play/reply/stop buttons and functionalities so that they acted the way that the user would expect them to act.
                            | The activities also do not overlap each other anymore, so if the user chooses to do meditation, and then chooses to do yoga or
                            | the breathing exercise, the activites do not overlap.
                        p
                            | Phi added a few more yoga scripts and animated routines that we were able to show off during our dry run. The yoga room as well
                            | was attached to the main building. The user can now follow along the animated yoga routine in a secluded area in the garden.

                            | entities overall, overflowing the application. He started to combine the walls of the garden together into one entity, as well as
                            | combining and reducing the number of clouds as well. We also received feedback that the user should be teleported to the start of
                            | the clouds and hot springs scenes, so Hristo worked on adding that function of the user being teleported to the part of the garden
                            | where those scenes start.

                            | into one model. We also got feedback that the asset placement menu arrows should also be able to be clicked using the raytracer of the left

                            | This addition eliminated the need for users to scroll to the end of the url and manually add their id, which is kind of annoying to do
                            | while using the headset. He also made improvements to the breathing exercise meditation experience with play/pause functionality.

                            | since last week, which was the new layout for the audio menu, as well as adding the "settings" portion below the main
                            | menu, so that the user could easily access the audio menu. As well as that audio menu, she worked on getting a Display

                            | cannot feel the water in the hot springs, it is very cool to see how the hands can still interact with the water. We also had some user feedback

                            | using the yoga models. Other than that we will continue to work on improving the aesthetic and functionalities of what we currently
                            | have to continue to improve upon the user experience.
                        ul
                            li Hristo: Write blog, work on making the menu more cohesive, add scenery assets to the mountain path.
                            li Phi and Matthew: Add yoga model animations to the yoga scene. Make yoga routines that user can follow using yoga models and animations.
                            li Jane: Add user ability and funtionality to adjust lighting in scene.
                            li Everyone: Keep an eye out on the different bugs that might cause occasional crashing and functionalities to not work. Continue to add to the aesthetic and anything that can improve the overall user experience.

                        p
                            | We did encounter a never before seen bug where the menu did not show up during our demonstration today at the open house.
                            | We think it may be just due to the fact that we were casting, have multiple people in the same room at a time, plus
                            | sharing screens on zoom. But looking out for those bugs that caused the error may be a difficult thing and a blocker for us.
                            | Other than that we are on the right track and are mainly focusing on fixing things that we already have.

                            | improvement after our MVP and started looking into and designing various stretch goals
                            | that we would like to add to our product in the coming weeks. As like last week, our current

                            | After realizing that there are many controls that players must know to fully take
                            | advantage of the application, Hristo added an introduction scene that the player
                            | is loaded into on startup. The player now comes in outside the garden in a shrine
                            | with instructions for how to use the controllers. Hristo also added in new wall assets
                            | that greatly improved our application's performance and fixed some issues with jitter in the new walls he added.

                            | and playing after the user selected some music. Jane worked on fixing these audio related
                            | issues so now audio handling is much improved. Furthermore, Jane added pause/play
                            | functionality to the audio menu. This was integrated into the yoga and meditation scripts
                            | so now the user may pause them when needed. Jane is currently working on improving the main menu U/I
                            | so the user may select from tabs to change music and other scene elements such as lighting.

                            | After feedback from the MVP presentation, Matthew experimented with a drag and drop
                            | asset placement mechanism meant to improve the feel of placing items. Now, the user places an 
                            | item by opening up the asset placement menu and using their other hand to drag and drop the
                            | item into the scene. Furthermore, to fill out the asset placement menu, Matthew also increased
                            | the number of placable assets in the asset menu from ~16 to 60. Matthew also continued to improve
                            | the breath meditation feedback mechanism and now we have a working solution.

                            | In particular, the asset placement menu was bugging out when multiple people attempted to
                            | place assets but changes to the menu seems to have resolved whatever issues there have been related
                            | to this. Also, after people gave feedback that it would be better for each person to control their own
                            | lighting and music, we now do not mirror any of this information between user browsers. We are still looking
                            | into an effective way to introduce synchronized meditation or yoga that would also allow the user
                            | to have a personal meditation session if they want. Finally, we had some fun stress testing the garden to see
                            | how many high poly items we could place before FPS dropped off on the Oculus Quest 2, and got up to ~200 items.

                            | add another scene location to the garden that users may meditate at in the mountains that surround the garden.
                            | This will build upon the cloud meditation mode that allows you to climb to the clouds to get a better view of the
                            | surroundings and garden (see video below).
                            | There are also some weird bugs related to using the meditation menu in multiplayer that we are still
                            | trying to pinpoint, so we will all be working on fixing this as well.

                            | We believe this is not something that we can realistically integrate into our existing application
                            | in 2.5 weeks since it would require an external camera and GPU server, not to mention all the front 
                            | end related work that would be needed once we finish getting the infrastructure set up and finish training
                            | a model to classify yoga poses. This is something that we are interested in doing but it might have to wait
                            | until after week 10.

                            | This week was spent exploring both meditation and yoga experiences. We expanded on the groundwork
                            | that we set up the previous week as well as resolving several bugs. Also we transfered our development
                            | environment from Glitch to local development with VSCode and the Live Server extension. Although this week was a busy
                            | and hectic week for everyone, we were still able to make solid progress.
                        h3 Successes and Accomplishments From This Week
                        p
                            | Matthew started researching and developing feedback for meditation mode. Users can use this feature by either lying down
                            | or standing and holding or placing the controller on their belly. The current implementation
                            | tracks the users controllers as they inhale/exhale and provides visual feedback with a ring that
                            | dynamically resizes with each breath. Breath tracking can currently accessed through the meditation menu and pressing the
                            strong x-button
                            | once it is selected in the menu. It can also be removed using the same button.

                        p
                            | Hristo and Jane worked on designing and improving the menu interface that we started last week. New additions
                            | include additional info text for each option as well as a volume slider. Jane made the menu items usable
                            | by integrating the meditation audios/scripts that she recorded and edited as well as the sounds she compiled. So far each
                            | meditation option plays a recording when clicked, but the yoga options are still currently placeholders. Jane also
                            | started implementing sound and music selection to give users finer control of the soundscape. Currently the menu can
                            | be activated and deactivated by pressing the
                            strong a-button
                            | and options can be selected using the
                            strong right trigger.

                            | Hristo also tried adjusting the lighting of the scene since the colors seemed a bit dull. He also tried adjusting
                            | shadows to improve immersion and the overall aesthetic.

                            | Phi worked on developing the yoga experience with recorded scripts as well as a display that leads a yoga session.
                            | He used some of his prior yoga experience to create slides with instructions as well as drawings with poses.
                            | Currently users do not use their controllers during a yoga session.

                            | Matthew also started implementing a home screen for users to select their room but that is still a work in progress.
                            | Jane also tried animating the sky, but proved harder than we initially thought it would be. We are currently exploring
                            | other methods of adding life to the sky like 3D cloud and star models.
                            | Overall, we feel as though we made decent progress this week.

                            | This past week has been been a slightly slower week because we are 'getting into the thick of the quarter' - Phi. But, most things are coming together and mostly depend on connecting
                            | the different elements together into a cohesive project. There are still some small hurdles that we may encounter in doing this, but we currently do not have any apparent blockers.

                            | This week started off with a successfully completed PRD and continuing the development of our
                            | various ideas for the project. The base of the customization of the garden as well as the start
                            | of the meditation activity of this app had been set so this week we spent a lot of time cleaning
                            | up small bugs and diving deeper into the activities part of our project, where the user will be
                            | able to participate in various relaxing activities in their zen garden.

                            | Matthew was able to figure out how to add the rotation aspect when placing on object on the floor.
                            | Instead of the small preview that was there before, when the user wants to place an asset in their
                            | garden, they will have an accurate representation of how the asset would look like when placed. This
                            | includes the orientation of the object in relation to the zen garden. There were a few bugs with the
                            | rotation from the previously small preview of the asset to the rotation of the actual size asset but
                            | making the preview of the asset the actual size of the asset itself seemed to work well.

                            | Matthew also continues to work on and manage the multiplayer component of this zen garden, continuing to 
                            | make sure that the different activities such as meditation are working on all views of the players. He has
                            | also been working on fixing up bugs from the open source code that we utilized.
                        p
                            | Jane continued to work on the meditation UI. She designed what "meditation mode" would look like, one of
                            | which was to have lanterns around the garden or close by that would light up, giving off a soft glow look
                            | which would light up as the sky dimmed, shifting the garden into "meditation mode". She started off by 3d modelling
                            | the "meditaion building", which for now is the big structure/room in the middle of the garden. She did not 
                            | have much luck on having that lantern glow effect, but Hristo was able to 3d model some awesome lanterns and lights 
                            | that would illuminate when the user enters meditation mode. Hristo also added the functionality of when the user
                            | teleports into the meditation room, "meditation mode" would be triggered and untriggered, so the user will enter
                            | "meditation mode" by teleporting into the room.

                            | writing meditation scripts and narrating them. She is also working on some audio editing to combine the scripts with music.

                            | to follow along with the yoga routine. He also added a timer to demonstrate how the user can see when they should go onto the next
                            | pose. But Phi also noticed that it may be difficult for the user to try and look at the slides while doing the pose, so maybe next steps
                            | in developing this would be to add a voice narration for the user to follow along, as well as the slides.

                            This past week has been going relatively smoothly. We may run into some blockers when working on user breath tracking, and lighting
                            in aframe has been a tricky ride. Also, we are out of disk space on glitch... so that is problematic. But it seems like we will be able
                            to switch and work from gitlab so we hope that will solve that problem. We still have a good vision and idea of what we should do for our tasks, however, so as of right now
                            we don't forsee any major blocking issues for the upcoming week.

                        p
                            | This was our first week where we started developing many of the ideas we have been sketching
                            | out. We also made some great progress on fleshing out our
                            a(href='deliverables.html#prd') product requirement document
                            | (PRD). We also completed out
                            a(href='deliverables.html#project-pitch') project pitch.
                            | We are excited to review the progress we made this week and get started with our tasks for
                            | next week.

                        h3 What every member did and Project Resources
                        p
                            | Collectively, we worked on the project presentation due April 13. We also split up
                            | responsibilities related to the PRD, then worked together to nail down the scope of the
                            | project and what we wanted to focus on each week. Particularly, after our presentation we
                            | realized that the meditation/yoga aspect was a more appealing feature than we previously realized
                            | so we tailored our PRD so that our garden customization is still present but simple so we can focus on interesting
                            | meditation tools.
                        p 
                            | Furthermore, we each started designing particular base components of our simulation that
                            | would be needed no matter what stretch goals we decided to focus on. In particular, Phi found
                            | some UI components that we could plug into our application and after deciding on a design Matthew
                            | ported the UI component from a
                            a(href='https://github.com/kfarr/aframe-city-builder/tree/f7f7c9c9ade67daa0c3d89c4aeb7f9021ad794d8') city builder game
                            | to work on the Oculus 2 with our plant assets. Similarly Phi got some basic
                            | asset placement and movement working with the UI. A simple way of undoing the last placed asset was added as well.

                        p
                            | Since we wanted some simple multiplayer interactions in our garden, Matthew set up Croquet integration
                            | with the project. This facilitates unique "rooms" that can be accessed by anyone by typing in a "room id".
                            | They can thus enter a room with others and view any modifications to the room and see the other players in the room 
                            | since assets are mirrored over using Croquet's view/model system.
                        p
                            | We also needed a simple way to navigate around the garden, so Hristo researched some teleportation based locomotion
                            | techniques and integrated a teleportation based system into our project with predefined checkpoints that the user
                            | may select to teleport to.

                            a(href='') this music management component.
                            | Once that was complete, she started developing what the meditation UI should look like and what sort of
                            | information we are going to be recording and giving feedback about to the user.

                        p.
                            Next week we plan on finishing up some of the bugs that we have yet to resolve in the UI and
                            start working on the meditation aspect of the project. In particular, we have assigned ourselves
                            the following:

                                            li Explore possibility of webcam capture for capturing body positions

                        p.
                            We believe we have a good grasp of what our initial product should look like, the
                            only thing left now is to continue to implement it! Right now there are a lot of tasks to do, all of which
                            are currently going smoothly so we don't forsee any major blocking issues the next week.

                        p.
                            In our first week, we got ourselves oriented with the tools we would be
                            using through the WebXR tutorial and discovered possible interesting
                            technologies we could use for our project in Glitch and Croquet through
                            the class tutorials. We created a team discord and set about coming up
                            with an idea for our project.
                        p.
                            We bounced around several before coming up with the idea of a virtual zen
                            garden - with Zendin as our working title! The idea of having a customizable,
                            relaxing open space in the virtual world was something that we all liked the
                            idea of and we came up with plenty of possible extensions from this - meditation,
                            gardening, yoga, and more! Virtual spaces can offer a new social outlet in an
                            interesting medium, and the pandemic has shown how sometimes we all need to get
                            away to our own space, which our virtual zen garden is an option we’re hoping to provide.

                            some meetings already to hash out the details of our product pitch presentation and our
                            project requirements document, so we have a solid base to build on while developing.
